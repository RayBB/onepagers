# Wikidat String to QID

This is a simple tool to convert a Wikidata string to a QID. Really helpful if you're trying to add something like a country to a Wikidata item. I'm [not the first](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Help_talk:QuickStatements) to ask for this but I couldn't find another tool as easy to use.

## Usage

Open the tool in your browser and enter the Wikidata string in the text area. The QID will be displayed below the text area.

## Alternatives

There's a really great tool called [Wikipedia and Wikidata tools](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/wikipedia_and_wikidata_tools/595109124715) that you can install in Google Sheets, but if you're not using Google Sheets, then my tool will also make it very easy for you to get what you want.
